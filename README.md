### Description:
The objective of our project is to develop an application that helps new students and some students who find the management of information from the Faculty of Mathematics confusing. This bot app will help with the most common doubts for them in the Faculty. of Mathematics of the Autonomous University of Yucatan and its adaptation to the institution

The scope of the project we have in mind is based on helping the user (through a bot), guiding them along the path of being a new employee and resolving any doubts that may arise along this journey. As this project focuses directly on new students, it is expected that they will promote the application with their experiences to future users who come in later years.

For the moment, we will focus on making the bot work with more generic questions to verify that its information is correct and up to date, trying to save as much time as possible, trying to add as much information during the development period.

### Users:
In this project we are focusing mainly on new students from the Autonomous University of Yucat√°n, more specifically in the mathematics faculty, however, any student from the university and the exact engineering campus will be able to use this app 


- Primary: New FMAT students
  
- Secondary: Students outside of FMAT
  
- Potential: Teachers and family members

### VALUE PROPOSITION
Our project consists of creating an application with an automated bot capable of answering frequently asked questions that new students at the UADY Faculty of Mathematics may have, using information directly provided by the institution's staff, this being the most up-to-date possible.

Our product will be able to store all the necessary information in one place, allowing users to answer all their questions related to the FMAT without the need to go to multiple sites. Furthermore, it manages to synthesize all the information requested without becoming confusing. 

This application is made based on the problem that several new students present, which is the difficulty of obtaining information related to the faculty, such as: Where is that room? How do I request a study certificate? What type of material should I bring?, among others. 

Our proposal has the value of solving a problem that new students present (obtaining information related to the faculty), which could help not only apply for the present, but also for the future.
