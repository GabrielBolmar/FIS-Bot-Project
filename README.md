## First Review Presentation:

### Description:
The objective of our project is to develop an application that helps new students and some students who find the management of information from the Faculty of Mathematics confusing. This bot app will help with the most common doubts for them in the Faculty. of Mathematics of the Autonomous University of Yucatan and its adaptation to the institution

The scope of the project we have in mind is based on helping the user (through a bot), guiding them along the path of being a new employee and resolving any doubts that may arise along this journey. As this project focuses directly on new students, it is expected that they will promote the application with their experiences to future users who come in later years.

For the moment, we will focus on making the bot work with more generic questions to verify that its information is correct and up to date, trying to save as much time as possible, trying to add as much information during the development period.
